# Opening links in the default app

One more feature that Memo has is opening links in the default app. For instance, you don't want to use
[vscode-pdf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomoki1207.pdf) as your default PDF viewer, then you can use right-click on [[Dummy.pdf]] link and choose `Open link in the default app` or execute this command via VSCode command palette to open the link in the system default app.
