# Backlinks panel

Backlinks panel shows how the current note is referenced in other notes.

All links are grouped by the filename and marked with `LINE:OFFSET`, so you can see within which line and at which offset a certain link is used. Clicking on the filename will bring you to beginning of the file that references the link and clicking on the link itself will bring your cursor to that link in the file.
