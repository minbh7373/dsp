# Creating links

You can use links to refer to any note in your personal knowledge base such as for instance a daily note [[2020-07-05]] or an image ![[Creating links.gif]].

You can assign label to the link using `|` pipe notation, as for instance done for [[2020-07-05|The day when I started writing this help]] note.

Another possibility that Memo provides is embedding other files as part of the note. Read more on that in [[Embed files]].
