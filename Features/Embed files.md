# Embed files

In [[Creating links]] you got acquainted with the links concept, and how one can create links to different resources using `[[Creating links]]` notation.

Another feature that Memo has is attaching other notes and images as part of the current note by using similar notation to regular links but with `!` in the beginning as in `![[Features]]`.

Let me show you how it works ðŸ˜‰.

You can embed any other note, for instance: ![[Features]]

Or you can embed an image: ![[Backlinks panel.png]]

At this point you can run `Markdown: Open Preview` command using the VSCode command palette to see what it looks like in the built-in preview.
